Hi everybody!

I am an economics PhD at University College Dublin. My research centers on the intersection of law, economics, and technology.

I am on the job market this year (2020 - 2021) and available for interviews.

My job market paper is available [here](https://www.cesifo.org/en/publikationen/2020/working-paper/patent-boxes-and-success-rate-applications).
